# AWS S3 Object Listing

List Bucket objects from AWS S3 as a file explorer by hosting it as a static website. I've forked the original repo from Rufus Pollock to add Twitter Bootstrap CSS

 1. Create Bucket in S3 and make it public.
 2. Enable Static Website Hosting for S3.
 3. Upload the `index.html` and `scripts` folder to your bucket.

TODO:
 - Add Table to File List

Thanks to [Rufus Pollock](https://github.com/rufuspollock/s3-bucket-listing) for his original work.
